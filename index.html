  <p1>A bundle of organic beets from a local farm food co-op program.</p1>
  <p2>55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.</p2>
  <p3>The usually deep purple roots of beetroot are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a cooked
vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and shredded, either
alone or combined with any salad vegetable.</p3>
  <q1>In fact, Jim Halpert once said this about beets, “Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, Battlestar
Galactica”.</q1>
  <q2>I have some weird habits. For instance, I love beets. Show me a salad bar and I will clean them
out of their beets.
